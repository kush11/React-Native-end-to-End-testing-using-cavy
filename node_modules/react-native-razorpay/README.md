React Native wrapper around our Android and iOS mobile SDKs

**Note**: Please update to the latest version of react-native and react.This package has been tested on version react-native 0.58. 

**Note**: We no longer support Swift 3 , moving forward we will only support the latest version of swift.This decision is based on the following link which states that Xcode 10 is the last version to support Swift 3. 

```
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_10_release_notes
```

**Note**: This release is meant for Xcode 10. We strongly recommend you to wait till the stable version of react-native that supports Xcode 10 comes out , we have made our fixes but it is still remommended that you wait.You can see here that react-native is still working on a stable Xcode 10 release.Please use your discretion.

**Note** : To avoid duplicate module name collisions please copy the example project to a separate folder and try.

**Note**: The iOS framework is shipped with simulator architectures , you have to remove them before you archive, just google  stripping simulator architectures and follow the steps.Also remember to enable bitcode on both your iOS project as well as the RazorpayCheckout project.

https://razorpay.com/docs/ios

After this replace the framework in  /node_modules/react-native-razorpay/ios/ 
and link your project either using react-native commands or manually.

The following documentation is only focussed on the react-native wrapper around our Android and iOS sdks. To know more about our sdks and how to link them within the projects, refer to the following documentation-

**Android** - https://docs.razorpay.com/v1/page/android/

**iOS** - https://razorpay.com/docs/ios/

## Installation

This has 3 steps: add to project, installation and linking iOS SDK.

### Add to project

Run the following on terminal from your project directory:

**Note**: For Windows users, run this on Git Bash instead of Command Prompt. You can download Git for Windows [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest).

```bash
$ npm i react-native-razorpay --save
```

### Automatic installation

```bash
$ react-native link react-native-razorpay
```

##### Manual installation

If the above command doesn't work for you (installation), try [these steps from wiki][wiki].

## Usage

Sample code to integrate with Razorpay can be found in
[index.js][index.js] in the included example directory.

To run the example, simply do the following in example directory and then
link iOS SDK as explained in the previous section:

`$ npm i`

### Steps

1. Import RazorpayCheckout module to your component:
    ```js
    import RazorpayCheckout from 'react-native-razorpay';
    ```

2. Call `RazorpayCheckout.open` method with the payment `options`. The method
returns a **JS Promise** where `then` part corresponds to a successful payment
and the `catch` part corresponds to payment failure.
    ```js
    <TouchableHighlight onPress={() => {
      var options = {
        description: 'Credits towards consultation',
        image: 'https://i.imgur.com/3g7nmJC.png',
        currency: 'INR',
        key: 'rzp_test_1DP5mmOlF5G5ag',
        amount: '5000',
        name: 'foo',
        prefill: {
          email: 'void@razorpay.com',
          contact: '9191919191',
          name: 'Razorpay Software'
        },
        theme: {color: '#F37254'}
      }
      RazorpayCheckout.open(options).then((data) => {
        // handle success
        alert(`Success: ${data.razorpay_payment_id}`);
      }).catch((error) => {
        // handle failure
        alert(`Error: ${error.code} | ${error.description}`);
      });
    }}>
    ```

A descriptive [list of valid options for checkout][options] is available (under
Manual Checkout column).

## Things to be taken care:

- The react native plugin is wrapper around native SDK, so it doesn't work with the tools like expo which doesn't support native modules.
